Dimension of data we report:
- realizations (or "runs" or "scenarios")
  - time-windows (or "time")
    - counties (or "nodes" or "space")

** Let's 
- realizations (or "runs" or "scenarios")
  - counties (or "nodes" or "space")
    " do not need separate json blocks)
    - time-windows (or "time")

- (hierarchy is flexible)
- likely better to put counties then time
- the "actual" data is (maybe) just another "run")




Workflow #1:
         - for each scenario
                  - load data
                  - perform reconstruction for single scenario
                  - for each window
                    - solve all counties simultaneously

Workflow #2:
         - for each scenario
                  - load data
                  - perform reconstruction for single scenario
                  - for each window
                    - for each county
                      - solve individual county for beta

Workflow #3:
         - for each scenario
                  - load data
                  - perform reconstruction for single scenario
                  - solve one formulation for all counties and windows
