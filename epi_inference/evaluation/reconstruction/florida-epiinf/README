This folder tests the stochastic reconstruction code using simulated data
run:
epiinf reconstruct-det config/FL.yml
epiinf reconstruct config/FL.yml
epiinf postprocess config/FL.yml
python bin/reconstruction_figs.py

This will generate a figure in figures that contains the reconstructions
and the simulated data on the same plot for each of the counties.
It also shows the lower (2.5%), simulated, and upper (97.5%) values
for the reconstructions (with the simulated value) at the final time.
