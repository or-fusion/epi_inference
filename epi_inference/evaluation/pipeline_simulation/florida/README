This folder contains the input necessary to run some test simulations
with Florida configuration for testing the inference results.

A particular config is run using:
> python ../path/to/simulate.py -c config_R0_1.25.yml -n100
... Run this for all the config_R0_x.xx.yml files to generate the simulated data
(where you need to use the path to your simulate.py from the COVIDScenarioPipeline)

After you run the simulations and build the results, you need to run
> python convert-parquet-data.py
This will create the csv files needed for the inference tests.
These are written to:
./single_county_inference
